This site can load without a server! Clone this repository to your computer &
just open the [index file](index.html) in a web browser!

## Section Text Modification
Changes to text in each website section can be made by modifying & saving template files.
These files are dynamically loaded into the [index file](index.html) via JavaScript.
Each file primarily uses [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet) syntax & also supports HTML syntax.

* [home](templates/home.md.js)
* [about](templates/about.md.js)
* [contact](templates/contact.md.js)
* [video](templates/video.md.js)
* [donate](templates/donate.md.js)
* [subscribe1](templates/subscribe1.md.js) (subscribe picture)
* [subscribe2](templates/subscribe2.md.js) (sermons)
* [subscribe3](templates/subscribe3.md.js) (podcasts)
* [subscribe4](templates/subscribe4.md.js) (prayer tracks)
* [subscribe5](templates/subscribe5.md.js) (Spiritual Maintenance book)

To modify the files, log into your GitHub account, navigate to the relevant file in this repository
& click the Pencil button to the top-right of the file. Once you've made your edits, click the
`Commit changes...` button. A form will appear in a modal asking you for additional information. Fill
in fields, where deemed necessary. This information makes it easier to review past changes. When done
click the `Commit changes` button in the modal. That's it! Refresh the site in your browser to confirm
your changes had the desired effect. There may be a slight delay while the changes are deployed.

### Templating
Each of these templates use [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet) syntax, embedded into a JavaScript variable.
This allows JavaScript functions to be called during template rendering.
